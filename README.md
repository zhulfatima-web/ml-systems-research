# ML Systems Research Portfolio

## About
Computer Science student focused on computational efficiency and systems-aware machine learning. 
Interested in bottleneck analysis, memory–compute trade-offs, and scalable model design.

## Research Focus
- Memory-bound vs compute-bound bottlenecks in deep learning
- Training and inference pipeline optimization
- Attention restructuring and sparse computation
- Data loading and gradient accumulation strategies

## Projects

### 1. Algorithm Performance Benchmarking
Empirical evaluation of sorting and graph traversal algorithms across input sizes 10^3–10^6.
Focus: cache locality, memory access patterns, runtime scaling.

### 2. Database Indexing Optimization
Schema normalization to 3NF and performance evaluation of indexing strategies.
Focus: query latency and throughput analysis.

### 3. Robotics Control Under Latency Constraints
Resource-aware control logic under strict hardware and timing limitations.

## Tools
Python, NumPy, basic ML frameworks, benchmarking methodologies.
